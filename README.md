# CAN-BUS-Man-In-The-Middle 2: The fork awakens.

CAN BUS Man In The Middle for spying on and modifying automotive CAN traffic on the fly.

Firmware originally designed to allow use of a Tesla Gen 2 Battery charger in a gen 1 Nissan Leaf.
I unashamedly forked it to make the cheap odometer defeat tools usable for more wholesome reasons.

Hardware originally designed to defeat odometer mileage.

This fork is purely for personal use and therefore has no expectation of:
- being to any sane standard.
- working.
- safe.

At this moment in time, for me alone:
- Compiles.
- Talks via UART on the device.
- Has not touched anything CAN.

What am I intending to doing with it:
- Modifying data sent to an entertainment status display intended for a newer model than supported by my car. (Peugeot 508 display into 407).
